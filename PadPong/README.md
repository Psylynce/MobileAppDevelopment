While building this I ran into some issues. Besides trying to learn cocos2d and box2d in time a lot of my ideas didn't quite work out. It was a challenge to try and learn cocos2d and box2d at the same time and understanding exactly what was going on.

There are also some warnings I tried to get rid of but I couldn't, like some depreceated methods that were prevalant for iOS5. I think it's because I used cocos2d v 1.0.1 which came with some of those functions built in.

Also, at some points the ball (square) will spawn along the horizontal line down the middle and will bounce back-and-forth indefinitely.

I tried to implement a reset to the game but everything I tried crashed the game on the next score. So I couldn't get that feature in the app.

I also couldn't get the score to stop after a certain point and reset the game, because that crashed the app again and I couldn't figure out exactly why.

Lastly, I didn't really have time to get AI working so it's now an infinite two-player game of pong. Well it is until you close the app.

I did get the basics fundamentals of the game down, which was a challenge in and of itself. I hope you enjoy playing the game, even though it's not as polished as I would have liked it to be.
